# Job listings with filtering

My solution to an intermediate level [Frontend Mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io) challenge.

In this project I implemented the component approach with Pug, SCSS and ES modules.<br>
Built using Parcel, animated with [Anime.js](https://animejs.com).

Users are able to:
- filter job listings based on the categories;
- see the selected categories and the filtered listings after refreshing the page.
